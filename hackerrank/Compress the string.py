In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools . To read more about this function, Check this out .

You are given a string . Suppose a character '' occurs consecutively  times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character '' with  in the string.

For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.
