"""
Given a binary matrix. Find the maximum area of a rectangle formed only of 1s in the given matrix.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4, m = 4
M[][] = {{0 1 1 0},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 0 0}}
Output: 8
Explanation: For the above test case the
matrix will look like
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
the max size rectangle is
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
and area is 4 *2 = 8.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function maxArea which returns the maximum size rectangle area in a binary-sub-matrix with all 1â€™s. The function takes 3 arguments the first argument is the Matrix M[ ] [ ] and the next two are two integers n and m which denotes the size of the matrix M.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n*m)
Expected Auixiliary Space : O(m)

Constraints:
1<=n,m<=1000
0<=M[][]<=1

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
